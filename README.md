👋 Welcome to My GitHub!
Hi there! I work at the intersection of **AI, machine learning, and robotics** 🤖.  
My projects focus on **robot perception, automation, and intelligent systems**, ranging from hands-on robotic experiments to ML-driven tools and simulations.

🌱 Currently Exploring
- ROS 2 and Gazebo for robotic simulation and control  
- Computer vision and sensor-based perception systems  
- Learning-based control and reinforcement learning for robotics  
- Building practical AI tools that solve real-world problems
